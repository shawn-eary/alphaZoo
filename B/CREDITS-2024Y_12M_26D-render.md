## Dual Use
The bulk of this project is Open Source and can be found at:  
https://github.com/shawn-eary/alphaZoo  
However, there may be times where for the final YouTube rendering that I choose to use proprietary software, assets or tools. Those will not be included in the Open Source Repo 

## Errata
